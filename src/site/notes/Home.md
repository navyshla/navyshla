# Navyshla Home Page

Welcome to the ***World of Navyshla!***  

##### Attributions
- Significant portions of the lore were created by the players of the game. Where this has occurred, attributions are made to the player at the bottom of the page.
- Portions of this site's text were generated by ChatGPT prior to editing.  Where this has occurred, attributions are annotated at the end of the page.
- Currently, some images were created with AI art websites and some were created using HeroForge's modeling application for miniature generation. Where this has occurred, attributions are annotated at the end of the page. Note, HeroForge modeling is the default art for NPCs and will likely remain in place other than for major NPCs. The predominant AI tool used for art generation was Leonard AI. Those images will be removed and replaced with art generated by the author, Paul Krikau.
